Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort:

Comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Time Complexity (Worst Case): O(n^2)
Merge Sort:

Divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.
Time Complexity (Worst Case): O(n log n)
Quick Sort:

Divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The process is then applied recursively to each sub-array.
Time Complexity (Worst Case): O(n^2), but on average O(n log n)
Insertion Sort:

Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
Time Complexity (Worst Case): O(n^2)
Big O Notation:

Big O notation is a way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity. It describes the worst-case scenario in terms of the input size. The notation is written as O(f(n)), where "f(n)" represents the growth rate of the algorithm with respect to the input size "n."

For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), it means that the execution time grows quadratically with the size of the input.

Evaluating Time Complexity:

To evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm:

Count the number of basic operations executed.
Identify the term that most contributes to the growth as a function of the input size.
Express the growth rate using Big O notation.
Selecting the Best Sorting Algorithm:

The choice of the best sorting algorithm depends on various factors, including the size of the input data, the nature of the data (e.g., partially sorted or uniformly distributed), and the available memory.

Small Data Sets: Simple algorithms like insertion sort or bubble sort may be effective.
Medium to Large Data Sets: Merge sort or quicksort is often more efficient.
Memory Constraints: If memory is limited, algorithms like merge sort might be less practical due to their space requirements.
Stable Sorting Algorithm:

A stable sorting algorithm is one where the relative order of equal elements is preserved in the sorted output. In other words, if two elements have the same key in the original data, and one comes before the other, then their order will remain the same after sorting.

Examples of stable sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort. Unstable sorting algorithms, on the other hand, may change the relative order of equal elements during the sorting process. QuickSort is an example of an unstable sorting algorithm.
